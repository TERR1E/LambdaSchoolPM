# LambdaSchoolTA
CS9 Teaching Assistant Guide/Handbook

## Special Thanks
This repository is based on a fantastic repository under the same name put together by [Patrick Kennedy](https://github.com/mixelPixel/LambdaSchoolTA).

Thank you Tai the Thai and all of the other TAs for answering all the questions I've ever had. Now and in the future.

[Lambda School](https://github.com/LambdaSchool) for giving me the opportunity to learn code and the knowledge I needed to write this markdown document.

  <summary>Priorities</summary>

  <p>
  ##If you're clocked in, code review is the top priority.
    
  In-depth code reviews have the most impact.

  Code reviews should be done during morning instruction. The emphasis should be on current PR's, not past ones.  

  The Queue should be covered in the afternoon.</p>
