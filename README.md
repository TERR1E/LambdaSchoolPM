# LambdaSchoolPM
CS10 Project Manager Guide/Handbook

## Special Thanks
This repository is based on a fantastic repository under the name 'LambdaSchoolTA' put together by [Patrick Kennedy](https://github.com/mixelPixel/LambdaSchoolTA).

Thank you Thomas Dillard, Tai the Thai and all of the other PMs for your help and dedication, without you guys I would not be doing this today.

[Lambda School](https://github.com/LambdaSchool) for giving me the opportunity to learn to code and help others do the same in return.

  <summary>Priorities</summary>

  <p>
 
  ##If you're clocked in, code review is the top priority.
    
  In-depth code reviews have the most impact.

  Code reviews should be done during morning instruction. The emphasis should be on current PR's, not past ones.

  The Queue should be covered in the afternoon.
